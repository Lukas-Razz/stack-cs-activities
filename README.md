# The Stack of Computer Science Teaching Activities

Teaching computer science concepts in lecture halls? Boring! We prefer active learning methods. That's why we created the Stack: an open-source collection of teaching activities. Each activity in the Stack features a thorough description, printable handouts, and supporting materials for teachers to easily use in their classes. For free.

## List of activities

This is the full list of activities in the Stack divided into categories. The activities within each category are listed in the alphabetical order and include a brief description.

### Flagship activities

Tested in practice numerous times, iteratively improved, and beautifully designed, these are the activities we're especially proud of.

* [Encryption modes](activities/encryption-modes/README.md) -- Learn block cipher modes of operation, their properties and use cases from scratch.

### Theoretical CS and math

Activities to learn theoretical aspects of computer science and mathematics.

* [Properties of functions](activities/properties-functions/README.md) -- Practice the concepts of injective, surjective, and bijective functions.

### Programming and software engineering

If you teach programming, this is the right section for you.

* [Recursion with turtle graphics](activities/recursion-turtle-graphics/README.md)
* [Rubric of introductory programming skills](activities/rubric-introductory-programming-skills/README.md)

### Applied computing

Networks, operating systems, information technology, and other practical aspects of computer science.

* [Network flow monitoring](activities/network-flow-monitoring/README.md)

### Generic activities

These activities are content-agnostic and can be easily adapted for teaching various topics.

* [Creating quiz questions](activities/creating-quiz-questions/README.md)
* [Vzájemné zkoušení se](aktivity/vzajemne-zkouseni-se/README.md)
* [Otázková eliminace](aktivity/otazkova-eliminace/README.md)

### Activities under development

* [Aktivity na rozdělení do dvojic](aktivity/ib111/deleni/README.md)
* [Společné vytváření diagramu na tabuli](aktivity/spolecne-vytvareni-diagramu/README.md)
* [Vyjímky v C\#](aktivity/vyjimky-c-sharp/README.md)

## Useful links

* [A template for new activities](activities/README.md)
* [Draft ideas for new activities](activities-wip/ideas.md)
* [A list of processes](knowledge-base/seznam-funkcnich-prvku-procesu.md)
* [A list of artefacts](knowledge-base/seznam-artefaktu.md)
* [External resources](references.md)

## Contact us and join our efforts

Feel free to contribute your own activities (by creating a pull request). We also appreciate suggestions for improvement, notes on your experience or any other comments. Please, email Valdemar at *valdemar@mail.muni.cz*.

## Contributing authors

The Stack was conceived and is maintained by [Valdemar Švábenský](https://www.fi.muni.cz/~xsvabens/), a member of the [*Teaching Lab*](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/DUCIT) community at the [Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University](https://fi.muni.cz).

However, the Stack wouldn't exist without the significant contributions of other Teaching Lab members, especially Martin Ukrop and Ondráš Přibyla.

We also thank the authors of the activities (in alphabetical order): Radka Cieslarová, Jaroslav Čechák, Lukáš Daubner, Jan Horáček, Martin Macák, and the CSIRT-MU team.
